# Beer Scraper

This is a cheap-ass utility to read the beer list from websites of local beer
joints and breweries.  At this point, it's just an experiment for using the
[Colly](https://github.com/gocolly/colly) web scraping framework for Go.

## TODO
* API beer fetcher (Untappd, Taplister, BeerMenus)
* Google Sheets beer fetcher (for cloudburstbrew.com)
* Serve beer lists up on generated HTML pages
  * Use some kind of stylesheet to make it look decent
  * Eventually make the page more intelligent and let it pull a list from a JSON endpoint
